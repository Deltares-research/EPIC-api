## About EPIC-Tool backend
The EPIC-Tool backend uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a python web framework, which will be used by the frontend as an API.
For the current approach (Django + Vue) we will follow an approach similar to the one described in the following [vue+django guide](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/vue-django-getting-started-88d3f4c2ba62), and [django restapi guide](https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-first-rest-api-with-django-rest-framework-e394e39a482c) kudos to Bennett Garner for these extremely helpful resources.
